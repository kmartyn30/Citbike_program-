# Citbike_program-
proposal and visuals 

Overview of the analysis: 
The project purpose was to convince investors that a bike shared program in NYC would appropriately be a solid business proposal in Des Moines as well. The investors required more data since they felt this was a key stakeholder investment plan and wanted to see the bike sharing plan as a bike trip analysis. For this analysis the proposal required tweaking using Panda to change the trip duration to integer datetime datatype. First we well create the data plan and then several visuals to support the propel for Des Moines.

 The assignment required two technical analysis changes to trip duration and by creating several visuals such as line graphs and heat maps to support the proposal. As you can see in the table for Citi bike trip data the trip duration was changed to datetime format.  




To dig deeper to convince the investors that this program was a plan that was to generate a lucrative bike sharing program, they designed several visuals with Tableau workbook. 

Create the Checkout Times for Users Viz.

First the data was converted to date type for trip duration data. The changes were using panda for trip duration. So the first assignment was to create a change to the trip duration to a datetime format. The next, presentation was as a visualization to explain using Tableau workbook the likelihood of using shared bike for a trip analysis of the program. This was to include the number of bike trips for all writers and genders for each hour of each day of the week.

  The first visual was checkout times for users. Recording the number of bikes up to 140k, with the hourly trip duration allocated by a 60-minute interval. 
The next graph visualization provides a trip duration by the hour for the number of bikes including up to 100K for gender of all, male, female, and unknown.

 The third visual was a heatmap of the trips by weekday per hour. the hours started from 12 am to 11pm. With the stop time projected daily seven days of the week for the trips by weekday per hour.

 The fourth heat map consisted of user trips by gender by weekday by the hour starting at 12am to 11pm. This was sectioned by gender male, female and unknown. the count concluded up to 30,749.

 Lastly, the visual graphic heatmap user trips by gender by weekday. This was projected by usertypes such as customers and subscribers for 7 days of the week. This was also segregated by gender male, female, and unknown.

Overall, the citbike project was a success program as you can see in the map indicated the usage of Citi bikes in NYC area based from the last visual. As well as the impressive numbers of approzimately two million bikes being used for bike trips.
