# Citbike_program-
proposal and visuals 

Overview of the analysis: 
The project purpose was to convince investors that a bike shared program in NYC would appropriately be a solid business proposal in Des Moines as well. The investors required more data since they felt this was a key stakeholder investment plan and wanted to see the bike sharing plan as a bike trip analysis. For this analysis the proposal required tweaking using Panda to change the trip duration to integer datetime datatype. First we well create the data plan and then several visuals to support the propel for Des Moines. 

 The assignment required two technical analysis changes to trip duration and by creating several visuals such as line graphs and heat maps to support the proposal. As you can see in the table for Citi bike trip data the trip duration was changed to datetime format.  

To dig deeper to convince the investors that this program was a plan that was to generate a lucrative bike sharing program, they designed several visuals with Tableau workbook.
